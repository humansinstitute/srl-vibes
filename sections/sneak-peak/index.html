  <h2>Automation with Agents</h2>
  <p class="section-intro" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">It's great that Wingman can stand up an app, but the goal is to let it join the business. Point it at real tasks and invite it to add value where teams feel pressure.</p>
  <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; color: #dcdcdc;">For this next task we're going to use an AI agent, not to code and app but to operate it and add value, like a useful little assistant!</p>
