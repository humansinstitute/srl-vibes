  <h2>Sneak Peak — Automation with Agents</h2>
  <p class="section-intro" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">It's great that Wingman can stand up an app, but the goal is to let it join the business. Point it at real tasks and invite it to add value where teams feel pressure.</p>
  <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; color: #dcdcdc;">For this next task we're going to use a goose agent, not to code, but to follow a process and give you a daily summary of your tasks, like a hard working assistant!</p>
