    <h2>What actually is AI?</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">At the end of the day, it is a computer that can talk back, but it has read a lot more than us.</p>
    <p>AI is just software that recognizes patterns really well and uses them to predict the next best thing to say or do.</p>

<!-- How prompts work -->
<section class="section mid" id="how-prompts-work">
  <h2>How prompts work</h2>
  <p class="section-intro">Think of it like finishing a sentence, but at super‑speed.</p>
  <ul class="step-list">
    <li>The model reads your words and turns them into numbers it can understand.</li>
    <li>It guesses the next word based on patterns it learned from lots of text.</li>
    <li>It keeps guessing, word by word, until it builds a full response.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Why use AI?</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">AI bends the curve — it makes time and effort go further than they used to.</p>
    <p>It is leverage: drafts faster, explores more options, and helps you ship sooner.</p>

    <h2>Set &amp; Setting</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">Your mindset and environment matter. Treat AI like a collaborator, not a vending machine.</p>
    <p>Be clear about goals, share context, and iterate with feedback. That is how you get great results.</p>
